Currently I'm a PhD student at the University of Brescia tutored by associated Professor Martini Paolo.
We are currently developing a computational approach called ASTRA (Allelic Specific Transcriptional Regulation Analysis), organized as a Snakemake workflow and R package, enabling integrated analysis of Allele Specific Expression and/or Allele Specific Accessibility from bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data.
