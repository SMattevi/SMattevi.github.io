Stress is a primary risk factor for psychiatric disorders such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The response to stress involves the regulation of transcriptional programs, which is supposed to play a role in coping with stress. To evaluate transcriptional processes implemented after exposure to unavoidable traumatic stress, we applied microarray expression analysis to the PFC of rats exposed to acute footshock (FS) stress that were sacrificed immediately after the 40 min session or 2 h or 24 h after. While no substantial changes were observed at the single gene level immediately after the stress session, gene set enrichment analysis showed alterations in neuronal pathways associated with glia development, glia&ndash;neuron networking, and synaptic function. Furthermore, we found alterations in the expression of gene sets regulated by specific transcription factors that could represent master regulators of the acute stress response. Of note, these pathways and transcriptional programs are activated during the early stress response (immediately after FS) and are already turned off after 2 h&mdash;while at 24 h, the transcriptional profile is largely unaffected. Overall, our analysis provided a transcriptional landscape of the early changes triggered by acute unavoidable FS stress in the PFC of rats, suggesting that the transcriptional wave is fast and mild, but probably enough to activate a cellular response to acute stress.
