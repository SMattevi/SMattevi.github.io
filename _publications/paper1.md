- abstract: Stress is a primary risk factor for psychiatric disorders
    such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post Traumatic Stress
    Disorder (PTSD). The response to stress involves the regulation of
    transcriptional programs, which is supposed to play a role in coping
    with stress. To evaluate transcriptional processes implemented after
    exposure to unavoidable traumatic stress, we applied microarray
    expression analysis to the PFC of rats exposed to acute footshock
    (FS) stress that were sacrificed immediately after the 40 min
    session or 2 h or 24 h after. While no substantial changes were
    observed at the single gene level immediately after the stress
    session, gene set enrichment analysis showed alterations in neuronal
    pathways associated with glia development, glia&ndash;neuron
    networking, and synaptic function. Furthermore, we found alterations
    in the expression of gene sets regulated by specific transcription
    factors that could represent master regulators of the acute stress
    response. Of note, these pathways and transcriptional programs are
    activated during the early stress response (immediately after FS)
    and are already turned off after 2 h&mdash;while at 24 h, the
    transcriptional profile is largely unaffected. Overall, our analysis
    provided a transcriptional landscape of the early changes triggered
    by acute unavoidable FS stress in the PFC of rats, suggesting that
    the transcriptional wave is fast and mild, but probably enough to
    activate a cellular response to acute stress.
